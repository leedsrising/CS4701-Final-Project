the longer you look at it, the funnier it gets...
Nah, we're in the States.  That is 100% her.  Man, I've gotta tell her.  I'm gonna tell her tonight.  I emailed the pic to a couple other friends and they said it's def her as well.  
You were driving in the bus lane on Pratt, weren't you.
But there's so *many* of them.
Not a good living, unless you're a great bartender or in the catering or 'cater to' business.
Where did Meth come into this whole mess?

[Arkham Horror](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror), how do you play Risk solo?
No pets. No liner either but its spread on the carpet. A camera is an interesting idea, but I think this is a common phenomenon so I figured I'd ask reddit. 
Alright I have to ask.  Like the Seinfeld episode, is there such a thing as a bathroom book alert?
This, for the WIN!

Who do you think the terrorists are?
Is it just me or is the core of the soap very weak compared to the outer part of the soap?
I never claimed there was an afterlife.
A little. My Mum didn't want me when I was born, after a traumatic birth and we never really 'bonded'. I' close to my Dad though. They are still together, but I only really bother with him.
It took about about 3 days to do 550gb for my computer.  What kind of CPU do you have? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar As for the publishing I'm wondering myself what the best way to do that is.
Ice Levels. Fuck those. newlinechar  newlinechar Fix'd.
It's all good. You're right though, when I think 'token black guy' I think that dude from Not Another Teen Movie, not necessarily Morgan Freeman as God.

And I still think that I am right... how about that eh?
Okay, how about they support things people are likely to use, then?
What?
Yeah, I was discussing just this over voice chat with my buddies on the PS3. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh... wait... newlinechar  newlinechar Voice chat and party play are more than worth 35$ a year.

Depending on where it's seated and if it moves, it could conceivably work itself downward and if your cervix is regularly being hit there could be bad times for a male partner.
Was just about to post that.. :)
I think it was the botox that did her in.

I'm pretty sure I was there. Orange Peel?
we should both blame the EU for their Twinkie embargo
I couldn't watch past the TERRIBLE MUSIC, sorry.
So the discussion is over then. You've read the arguments and found them unconvincing. 
That would be fun. I don't think I could swim fast enough to catch any food though.
Did that happen to you?
It's because if the guy plays a pivotal role in the  movie, he is not a token black guy.
Barbara Waters said about the same in a interview she was conducting 40 plus years ago.  She said 'Men pay for it one way or another.'

That may be true, although from what I've read, the wealth is being concentrated with few workers being able to afford the products they create.  I would imagine a true Chinese consumer class would take some time to build.
That may be true, but trying to act tough on an internet board to strangers whom you don't even know is a bit unnecessary
Maybe so, but then what about this tradition - did the cardinals really used to view and comment on the testicles of a new pope?
So things like 'gosh, this tummy is smaller than it used to be... sexy...rrrrr' (those last rrrrrs are like a tiger) would be a nice thing to say?
Do you have the link?
Haha thanks. I'm the only person making this music though haha.. 7 Minutes Dead is just me.
I would not altogether ignore the reviews..

That's a beautiful piece you have there, sir. May I inquire as to where you purchased it?
Yes, I said that. But what exactly about it are you asking about?

I like it when I can wear her as an asshat, although it's not really practical when I go to work.
Good point!  Well I'll be the 22 yr old ginger-ish looking guy passed out on the median most likely, but just give me a few good pokes and I'm sure I'll be as good as new.

Oh, come on. Elton John doesn't even write his own songs. He's not an artist- he's a performer.
Ah, the dullard speaks.  Well, since you have nothing to say beyond 'neener neener', I guess I'm done battering you around.  Have the last word if you must, you half-witted cretin.
